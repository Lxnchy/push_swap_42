Mean for list of size 100 : ~570 operations

Mean for list of size 500 : ~4500 operations

My push_swap is extremely slow because it calculates all valid moves for each move made and chooses the best move to make.
The program can therefore take more than 5 seconds (on iMacs in 42 Paris) to process a list of 500 elements.
Despite its slowness it is rather effective !

If you're a 42 student and haven't nailed this project yet,
do your own research and don't foolishly read ready-made code,
you won't learn anything and you'll waste time.
